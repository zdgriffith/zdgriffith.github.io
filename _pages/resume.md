## Professional Interests
I'm interested in opportunities to apply cutting edge machine learning solutions in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment.

## Programming Skills

#### Python
NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter, Sphinx

#### Other tools
git, Bash, SQL, Docker, HDF5, Latex

## Education

Ph.D. in Physics (graduating December 2019)<br>
University of Wisconsin-Madison

Bachelor of Science with distinguished honors in Physics (GPA: 3.85)<br>
University of Northern Iowa

### Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center
Graduate Research Assistant || June 2013 &mdash; Present || Madison, WI

- Constructed a machine learning pipeline utilizing a random forest classifier to reduce a 10 TB dataset of ~160 million samples down to a 16 MB dataset of ~350,000 candidate gamma rays
- Applied statistical analysis methods to test for significant evidence of high-energy gamma-ray emission, succeeded in placing world-best limits
- Utilized high-throughput computing for physics processing of large TB-scale datasets
- Contributed to and maintained internal statistical analysis software widely used within the IceCube Collaboration
- Honed verbal communication skills through presentations to hundreds of scientists at international conferences

### University of Wisconsin-Madison 
Astrophysics Research Experience for Undergraduates || May 2012 &mdash; August 2012 || Madison, WI
- Processed optical data of galaxy merger systems taken by the WIYN telescope using the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility software
- Analyzed data through stellar population modeling with IDL

### University of Northern Iowa
Research Fellow || May 2011 &mdash; August 2011 || Cedar Falls, IA
- Utilized Origin, Matlab, and Mathematica software to analyze data
- Tested the magnetic properties of nanotube structured manganese-intercalated tantalum disulfide samples using a Physical Property Measurement System

### University of Northern Iowa
Research Fellow || May 2010 &mdash; August 2010 || Cedar Falls, IA
- Developed a Fortran code base to model a hypothesized protoplanet collision with the planet Uranus during its formation
