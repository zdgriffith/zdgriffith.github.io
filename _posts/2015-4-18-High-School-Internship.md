This past semester I organized a weekly 2-hour lecture series for a group of high school students interested in science.  I reached out to departments around UW-Madison and at neighboring colleges to bring in graduate students, post-docs, and even a professor(!) who shared their passions with these students and illustrated what opportunities are available to them.  In the end, we were able to hear from experts in physics, engineering, astronomy, chemistry, biology, and psychology.  Some highlights include:

- A very engaging lecture on synesthesia (one of the participating students actually had grapheme-color synesthesia!)
- Finding out what working with rats is actually like
- Touring the Tokamak plasma experiment on campus

A lot of great discussion was had, and the students got exposure to some of the different kinds of scientific research out there.  I very much enjoyed moderating the discussion and learning with the students.
