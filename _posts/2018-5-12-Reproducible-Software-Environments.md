Earlier this month I gave a talk at the IceCube collaboration meeting in Atlanta covering the basics of setting up reproducible environments for Python software development.  This has been a hot topic within the collaboration as we strive to increase the transparency and reproducibilty of analysis processes and results.

During the talk I addressed:

- pip and the Python package landscape
- virtual environments in Python 2 and 3
- virtualenvwrapper
- using virtual environments with distributed computing
- conda environments
- how to determine the right package manager for you
